# AqMetalSubsidy_Urban-Forested

This repository contains code developed for a manuscript currently in review for publication in Freshwater Science. 

Given that the data is not currently published, we only provide code and not the raw data. Once the manuscript is accepted for publication, we will add the raw data.

# Overview

Two types of files are currently available. 

All R code is contained in files ending in .RMD. Knitted documents for each of those files are provided as HTML; this is done to enable viewing of the outputs of the code, in the absence of raw data.

# Contact

The author of this repository, Jonathan Behrens, is more than willing to share the data that were inputs for this project, if requested. He can be contacted at jrb146@duke.edu or behrensjr@ornl.gov. 
If a request is made for the raw data, we ask you do not share it widely or use it without asking for permission first.
